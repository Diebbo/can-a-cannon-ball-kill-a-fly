# 3D Physics Simulator: Cannonball vs. Fly

## 1. Set up the environment
- [ ] Initialize PyBullet physics world
- [ ] Set up OpenFOAM for air flow simulation
- [ ] Create a 3D scene using PyVista

## 2. Model the objects
- [ ] Create a cannonball model (rigid body)
- [ ] Create a fly model (small, lightweight object affected by air currents)
- [ ] Model the surrounding environment (ground, obstacles, etc.)

## 3. Implement physics
- [ ] Set up gravity and other global physics parameters
- [ ] Implement cannonball launch mechanics
- [ ] Integrate OpenFOAM air flow simulation with PyBullet physics

## 4. Simulate fly behavior
- [ ] Model fly movement in response to air currents
- [ ] Implement basic fly AI (e.g., try to avoid the cannonball)

## 5. Collision detection and outcome determination
- [ ] Implement precise collision detection between cannonball and fly
- [ ] Define criteria for fly survival (e.g., proximity to cannonball, impact force)

## 6. Data collection and analysis
- [ ] Record data for each simulation run (cannonball speed, trajectory, fly path, outcome)
- [ ] Use Pandas to organize and analyze the data
- [ ] Apply statistical analysis to determine fly survival rates at different speeds

## 7. Visualization and user interface
- [ ] Create a 3D visualization of the simulation using PyVista
- [ ] Implement controls for adjusting cannonball speed and launch parameters
- [ ] Display real-time physics data and simulation outcomes

## 8. Optimization and machine learning (optional)
- [ ] Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to create a model that predicts fly survival chances
- [ ] Implement an AI to optimize cannonball trajectory for maximum fly-hitting probability

## 9. Performance optimization
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for running multiple simulations simultaneously
- [ ] Optimize the integration between PyBullet and OpenFOAM for real-time performance

## 10. Documentation and testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for the project
- [ ] Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure accuracy of the physics simulations

## Key Challenges
1. **Scale difference**: The size difference between the cannonball and the fly will require careful consideration in the physics simulation.
2. **Performance**: Integrating a CFD solver with a rigid body physics engine in real-time could be computationally intensive.
3. **Accuracy**: Ensuring that the fly's behavior in air currents is realistic and that the collision detection is precise.
